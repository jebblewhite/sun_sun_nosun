        Ah, I suppose you're right. Still, that makes me sad. The fishing, that is.
    
        It's odd that it makes me sad, isn't it?
    
        But I think it does. I've been thinking, much of it when I've been looking at this here river, and I think that I've figured out something."

        The river's both moving and it's not going to change. You see, all the other things are either boring, and I hate saying that about anything in this beautiful world but it's true, or it makes me sad.
    
        I used to go for walks along the crags, and those rocks and things are beautiful, but they're always the same, see? What do you think of when you think of the most beautiful mountain walk you can imagine? I'd wager you're thinking of a sunrise? Or sunset?
    
        Maybe a beautiful evening storm?
    
        But those don't happen any more. I mean storms happen, but without the light you can't hardly see their majesty.
    
        So it's horrible to say, but it's boring now.
    
        And then on the other hand, even though I don't go to the woods because they're dangerous, you have the forest and such. Or maybe a walk through the fields. But that's just sad instead, you know?
    
        Because with no sun, and this cold just getting worse, its dying.
    
        But this river, that's okay, because that's moving, flowing, changing. It still rains so the waterline still goes up and down, and I heard once that some man from one of those cities, where they pay people just to think, said "You can't step in the same river twice."
    
        I think that was supposed to make a clever point about something, but I can still see truth in it. But on the other hand, it is the same river and that's perfectly clear. It's always in the same place, water always flowing in the same direction.
    
        And I know that you could tell me that that can't be so, that it can't be different all the time and also the same, but I'm told I've got my eccentricities and what's the point in having them if you can't let yourself believe in some things that other folk say can't be?
    
        Also I figure that the most important thing is that it makes me happy to look at the river that way. Shows that it's possible for things to change without disappearing.

        You see, I've thought about this, and I hate to contradict anyone(if reputation with Nat is beyond a certain threshold then: ", especially someone I respect as much as you") , but I'm afraid that isn't true.
    
        I thought about it with a field, you see? Like after you've ploughed it and seeded and fertilised it, and then reaped it, it's still the same field, but it's all different stuff, right?
    
        Or, or take my shirt, now I know I don't dress very nice under my crier's coat, but I take care of what I've got and I've patched this shirt a good few times, but it's still the same shirt.
    
        Or just take me, I mean I was knee high once, but I'm still the same man now as the boy I was then, right?
    
        No, I'm sorry but the river is the river. That's how we can name it.
