    We live in a world where the sun really didn't rise tomorrow, so I will not say anything is impossible. But you would be hard-pressed to convince me that there will come a time when productive technology is so easily accessible that it will be available to more or less everyone.

    I am afraid that I cannot even picture what that technology would look like. Certainly it could not be something that produces material goods. But what else would that leave?

    You cannot be proposing a society so advanced that what people are willing to spend money on are just services.

    The problem we face is one of legacy. The bourgeois are feudal lords by a different name because money breeds money. Any kind of capitalist system will reward capital with capital, so the wealth will always flow to the top and just keep on flowing.

    Woah, where did that bit of hard-line statist-socialist policy come from?

    There are two points against abolishing inheritance, one of which I care about and one of which I don't.

    The one I don't care about, because I always start with the pointless one so the important one hits home, is that people aren't as selfish as capitalists would like you to think.

    You want people to work hard for themselves, but do you know how you really make people work hard? You make them think that what they are doing matters. The best way to do that is let people actually work for the ideal of the people. But the easiest way to do that is get them to work for their children and their families.

    Plus, isn't abolishing inheritance anti-liberal? I mean I don't care about that, but surely you should. People should be able to spend their money on whatever they want: drugs, sex, that extra carriage that they don't really need but will match their new mare that much better.

    But abolishing inheritance would mean the one thing they're not allowed to spend their money on is their own children. It comes across as cruel and arbitrary, even if it isn't.

    The kind of people who would drive an anarchist-capitalist world are not the kind of people who would accept inheritance laws. And good luck enforcing it with that kind of opposition.

    Which brings me to the actually important point: who is going to enforce it? And where will that capital go? There can, really, be only one answer: a state. 'Abolishing inheritance' is in all practical ways really instituting a one-hundred percent inheritance tax. No state, no tax.

    No, I couldn't. The social revolution will do many things, but it won't create infinite resources.

    Well the obvious practical step would be to ban inter-person trading. And really that does follow. To trade something one must have a claim on it, one must own it. But in a collectivised system, just because something is distributed to someone, it does not mean they own it.

    They do not own the object, they have equal access to the common source. Which, ah, yes, suggests another fix.

    This problem is most stark with clearly divisible objects, yes? In other words, products, the things that cannot be easily collectivised individually. But those aren't the factors of production, are they?

    Me trading my turnip for your sprouts isn't going to give me a capital advantage. Trading my turnip for a piece of your farm would, but that can't happen, because you don't have the same claim over land as you could be argued to have over your sprouts.

    In other words, it won't be possible to trade productive capital, because productive capital is non-divisible, and therefore cannot ever be distributed. All people within the society will have indivisible, equal and non-reliquishable access to all productive capital.

    So even if trading was allowed, which I'm not sure it would be, an anarcho-capitalist state would not follow, because capitalism requires the ownership of productive capital, and that will not exist under any circumstances after the revolution.

    After all, since it is the community that produces the goods, if an individual refuses to engage productively, or actively seeks to damage the community, then it follows that the community can refuse them the benefits of membership, if they decide they wish to.

    Or, to put the same thing in better words, every action within the community is voluntary. If someone voluntarily does not engage with the community, then the community cannot be forced to maintain a relationship with that individual. They may not force the person out of the area, but they can withhold all of the benefits of membership.

The kind of person you are talking about, and I'm sceptical that they would exist after the revolution but I'll play along, would likely hide a little horde for themselves.

    A fair point, if a practical one.

    Yes, it's not a brutally efficient solution. But it does have some elegant features. The first is the difficulty of the transit. I do not imagine that most communities will be too far from each other, although of course that is a wild guess, but even so, travelling from one to the other would give the 'trouble-maker' plenty of time to, as my mother always said, \"think about what they've done.\"

    It sounds trite, and maybe it is, but I would imagine that travelling alone and in exile would make anyone reflect on their behaviour.

    You may be unconvinced, and I don't blame you. Maybe the other advantage will convince you. Different communities will be made up of different people, people with different needs if their environments are different enough.

    If someone does not fit in with one group of people, they may very well fit in better with another. Just because it's a lesson most children learn, often the hard way, on the first occasions they are allowed to 'go out and play with the other children', doesn't mean it's not a valuable piece of sociology.

    Liberty means the expression of self. And utopia or no utopia, some people are simply not going to get along with each other. It's an unfortunate truth, but change the setting and the people, and someone who may have been a troublemaker once may become a fully productive member of the community.

    You may still be unconvinced, but I think the issue is more pressing for the traveller, not the communities they would travel through. No community would have an obligation to provide anything to someone who refuses to engage productively with the community, so there would be nothing wasted when the communities refuse to help the traveller.

    Either they would settle down, or they would keep drifting, receiving nothing from anybody who did not give away freely, until they died. Either way, they will have made their free choice, and I can't see that that choice would have harmed anyone else, one way or another.
