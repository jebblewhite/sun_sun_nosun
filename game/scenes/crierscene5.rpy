Being honest with yourself, you were unsure whether Nat would ever make it out of the forest. But, while some hours did go by without any sign of him, it did not take too long before the bells were ringing again.

At the very least, Nat has survived. But that is all you know as you mount the few steps up to the tower and push at the old wooden door.

Which doesn't move.

It's not locked. You can feel that much. Instead you guess that there must be something heavy blocking it on the other side.

    I'm okay now. I think it would be wrong if I tried to pretend to you that I wasn't scared right up until w...I got back here.

    You see, after I left you, the...thing took me through the forest, the colours on its head were flashing and swirling the whole way. I couldn't get a good look at it, it was too dark, but I got an, a general idea of what it must be like. Never seen anything like it before.

    Anyways, it took me to this little, well I suppose it was a lair but it was much nicer than that makes it sound. I'm sure there's a better word but I've never really had to deal with this kind of thing before so I'll just go with the one I heard used about the homes that dragons and the things like that are supposed to have in those fairy tales I was told as a kid.

    Anyway, sorry I keep getting off track don't I? And I suppose that's off track again, even just saying that.

    So anyway, it showed me its lair. It had found all sorts of stuff, weird shiny rocks and these hard, pitch-y sticks but also things that weren't natural, you know, like it had found a little tin soldier and a broken hoe and a couple of empty bottles.

    And it had this big old blanket that I think maybe one of the farmers used to use to keep the sickly cows warm in the winter, but I suppose that there aren't many cows left any more so I don't suppose they'd mind that they don't have the blanket any more.

    Anyway, the thing picked these all up one by one and showed them to me. Some of them were oh-so-pretty. Then, after it had shown me everything, it showed me a bunch of mushrooms. I think it wanted me to eat them, but I recognised them as some of the ones that Joan says might be bad for us, so I, well I guess I told it I couldn't eat them.

    It was quite late by then, around my normal bed time, and I think it knew I was tired so it pulled that old cow smelling blanket over me and we slept for a little bit.

    When we woke up, well, we, well, I suppose we tidied a few things up. And...came back here.

    Nat opens his mouth, ready to say something, when there is a sudden *thump* behind you, which you feel more than you hear.

    You turn and there, maybe just a few feet away from you, is the creature, fully visible in the moonlight streaming through the windows.

    Despite it being the only thing you've already seen clearly before, you notice the colours first: a swirling mixture of sky blue, grey and pink.

    The difference is, now you can see the colours in context.

    The creature's head, and indeed most of it's body, is roughly the shape of a dog's. However, it is the differences that are most noticeable.

    The colours exist in a semicircle, which looks to be somewhat like the consistency of an eye, but which takes up the entire top of the creature's head, starting from just below where a dog's eyes would normally be and moving all the way up and around, covering the entire area that would usually house a hound's brain.

    Weirdly, you are caught for a moment by the lack of ears, as the coloured portion of the head covers where they would usually be, but this is thrown from your mind when your eyes move down to the nose, or at least, where you had naively expected a nose to be.

    Instead you see something tapering, quivering from side to side, about four inches long, ending in a sharp point, the tip of which keeps opening and closing to reveal a minute, wet orifice.

    The creature moves slightly, and despite your macabre fascination, your eyes are drawn to the front legs. They're covered in the same silky smooth, pitch black fur as the rest of the animal, but that is where the similarities to normal dog legs end.

    You can tell just by looking at them, the way they twist around as the creature slowly repositions itself, that there are no bones in there. It's pure, incredibly strong, absurdly flexible muscle.

    Each limb is about five feet long, much longer than is needed for the creature, so they are coiled at the bottom. In other words, instead of front legs, it looks as if the creature is held up by boneless tails that it keeps curled into wide, flat disks.

    Possibly more shocking than all of this is that, as your gaze lifts up from these pads and scans back along the rest of the beast, you see nothing else unusual. The hindquarters are exactly what you would expect from an unusually uniformly black dog.
