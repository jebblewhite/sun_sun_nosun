There was no sign that there would be trouble until it started.

The day had been normal, or as normal as days ever are since the sun disappeared.  The busiest time for the town square, when most of the town comes out to collect food and wood and fur, was just coming to an end.  

The Alderman, who had been helping to organise the proceedings, was just returning to the Town Hall, walking up to the front door, when Alina stepped directly into his path, a large piece of paper held in her hand.

Her voice had been firm, and loud enough for everyone in the square to hear.

alina  """

Alderman Alexi, by order of, and by the power of, the Senate, I hereby relieve you of your duty as governor of this town.

I, as a representative of the Senate, have found your governorship wanting in many regards.  Most damningly, you have been unable to allocate resources appropriately during a time of crisis.

You have made no attempt to use your allocative powers to produce a solution to the current problem.

You have therefore put, and continue to put, the lives of the citizens, the Republican citizens, of Lotosk at risk.
"""

"""

There is a moment of shocked stillness.  The Alderman stands frozen in place, his body tilted as if time had simply stopped between steps.

Then he shifts, slowly, his legs coming together and his back straightening.  His arms quiver for a second as he fights the instinct to fold them across his chest, but he wins the battle and sends them down to rest by his sides.

His face is hard and neutral.

alderman  """

What you suggest, Officer Alina, or what you have suggested to me in private discussions, is to deny equal rations to those who do not work.

This favouring of some over others does not sound like the action of a democratic republic.  You say you act in the name of the Republic, but I was elected and you were not.  What you are doing, Officer Alina, is un-Republican.

Not to mention, of course and more importantly, that it is vile and immoral.  The good people of Lotosk will not stand by and watch as their fellow townsfolk die for lack of what they have in plenty.

As someone who's actually travelled this Republic, both as a soldier in its fine army and then as a man of commerce, I can tell you, Mr Alderman, that you're wrong.

Now I've fought the Kingdom, I've seen what the life of a serf is, and it's a life without freedom, without the opportunity to forge your own path and make your own destiny.  The Kingdom, our greatest enemy I remind you, tells its people what to do and lets them only take what it gives them.

Does that sound familiar to you, Mr Alderman?  Isn't that exactly what you've created here, your own little Kingdom where you can tell us what to do and what to take?  Even our fine hunters, like my son, can only keep what you let them keep.

Now fine Miss Officer Alina, why she is only proposing that we let each person take their own life into their own hands!  Let us work for our own survival, rather than having to beg it from you!
