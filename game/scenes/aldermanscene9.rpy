'In the event that the people believe their immediately appointed leader is acting against their interests,' the town's charter reads, 'they shall send a representative to address the Republic senate, who will judge the issue impartially and with the people of the town's interests as their chief concern.'

It does not take long before that single line starts circulating around the town and it takes even less time before everyone has an opinion on it.

Many lamely point out that 'impartially' contradicts 'and with the people of the town's interests as their chief concern', proving that they have a basic level of reading comprehension but little else.

Most point out the main problem: 'they shall send a representative to address the Republic senate'.  Some wield this line as a shield, others as a sword.  'There is no legal way', the former argue, 'to depose the Alderman, so we cannot depose the Alderman.'  The latter, meanwhile, say 'There is no legal way to depose the Alderman, so we must do it ourselves.'

Why 'there is no legal way' is self-evident.  Exactly who 'the Republic Senate' is is another matter of pointless debate, with some arguing it is a possibly non-existent social body hundreds of sunless and dangerous miles to the south, while others argue that, in all relevant ways, it is one woman regularly drifting in and out of confused consciousness in Fyodora's clinic.

Either way, both sides agree, it is out of Lotosk's reach.

You are [textinsert]involved in these discussions.  Your opinion on the logic of the charter and the exact nature on what you should take 'the Republic senate' to mean are, like everyone else's opinions on those matters, irrelevant.

But the main question remains.  What should be done about the Alderman?

        This town needs strong leadership.  It needs someone who knows it, someone with a strong understanding of not only the surrounding countryside and its resources, but also the infrastructure and people of the town.

        But more than that, this town needs someone who will protect it, and protect its liberties and equalities.  The people of this town are free, and they are all treated with fairness and equality.

        The people want change.  That is clear.  But I am convinced that what we are doing now is best for the town.  There is no fairer distribution of our resources than strict equality, and everyone has access to Fyodora's services.

        Any actual change would lead to a worsening of the people of Lotosk's living conditions.  And, I also strongly believe, a decline in the likelihood that we will survive.

        I am the only one in this town who has both the knowledge and the motivation to maintain those methods.

        So it is clear.  I cannot resign.

    Once Alina has recovered enough to agree, we will hold an election, a fair, open election.

    Lotosk is a democracy, as is the Republic.  It is clear that many of you will not be satisfied with me retaining my position, but I urge you to consider that Alina taking it with nothing more than a piece of paper is equally, if not more, undemocratic.

    So we will have an election.  And, of course, I promise to abide by the results.

    Even if the vote does favour Alina and her evil policies.

    The crowd seems satisfied with this.  True, some seem disappointed by the lack of immediate satisfaction, but most accept the reasonableness of the Alderman's suggestion, and, with a nod from him telling them that he has said all he is going to say, they begin to disperse.

    The Alderman smiles through gritted teeth until the crowd has left, and then he looks to you.  His face drops.  He doesn't even put in the effort to scowl.  

    He simply stares for several seconds,

    shakes his head,

    Your view is an uncommon one, but quickly picks up sympathisers.  There are many who oppose the Alderman, but do not believe him capable of what might very well be attempted murder.

    The debate tends to die quickly around you and those who argue the same as you.  You quickly find common ground on both sides of the argument, or rather both sides find common ground with you, and both tend to leave unhappy but at least a little more unified than they were before.  

    Still, your claim is not enough to sway the extremists on either side, those loyal to the Alderman refusing to agree to their leader's fallibility, while those accusing him of sabotage point out that you have failed to answer the question at the heart of the affair:

        The social revolution must take place through social, rather than political means.  

        It must be total and final.  Therefore anything that we achieve here will not be the social revolution, but merely a precursor.

        I feel a little bit like I have just been hit around the head, and maybe that is why I'm going to let these words flop out of my mouth:

        But you haven't done a bad job, for an Alderman.  You've been a good socialist, and not a terrible statist.

        But you have an important decision to make.  Will you let the people tear down everything: your power structures, your traditions and your laws?  Will you let it not just be collapsed, but torn apart and burnt?

        And if, as I suspect, you won't, then we, the people, have a decision to make.  Will we let that lie, or will we tear it down anyway, knowing that with it we must take the man who defends it?

        Lotosk is all that matters to me.  If it really is the will of the people, as an election will confirm, to leave the Republic and reject all government, then I will be happy to step aside.
