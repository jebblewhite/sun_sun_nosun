It has been decided, by who it is not quite clear, that it is your responsibility to make sure that Nat really does send [game.creature_name] back into the forest.

Enough people have been keeping an eye on the belltower's door that, your trust for Nat aside, you are confident that [game.creature_name] has not left her prison.

So, now that you hear a soft, slow knock on your door, you know that Nat has come to tell you that it is time for you to witness the exile.

When you open the door, he cannot meet your eyes.

I'm not ready [game.player_name]. You know, I don't think I'll ever be ready. And I really don't think that this extra little time has made it any easier.

But I had to let her out before, for her, and I have to do it again now.

"""

"There is a long pause. Tears land in the dirt at Nat's feet."

crier "I think you need to come with me now."

"""

Without checking whether you are behind him, Nat turns and walks away from you, towards the belltower.

He moves fast, even with his head down and shoulders slumped, so there would be no chance to talk even if either of you wanted to.

People stop what they are doing to gawk as you go past, but despite, or perhaps because of, them all knowing what your short march means, they all have the respect to let you go without following.

When you reach the belltower, Nat indicates for you to wait outside.

He is gone for a long time.

You are just considering going in, perhaps worried there has been some accident, or breakdown, or possibly that there might be some kind of trickery, but just before you make up your mind Nat appears, [game.creature_name] hobbling awkwardly beside him, one of its front limbs curled through Nat's gentle grip.

The only sign, save maybe the swirling black and pink of her 'eye', of [game.creature_name]'s emotions is her tail, curled between her legs and flat against her stomach.

Nat's distress is much more obvious.

He nods at you, and the three of you make a slow, silent trek towards the forest.

It is only when you have gone as far as you can go before actually breaking through the tree line that Nat finally speaks again.
"""

crier "[textinsert] you mind standing over there a bit? I don't mind if you can still see us, but, well, I'd like to be able to feel like we're alone. Just one last time."

"""

You can think of no good reason to deny Nat's request, so you walk a little way into the tree line, keeping Nat and [game.creature_name] in your sights the whole time.

Nat, unsurprisingly, is crying. You see his mouth opening and closing, though you are too far away to know if he is actually saying anything. Not that it would matter either way. Nat has been aware of [game.creature_name]'s deafness for some time. He seems to find it strangely endearing, or perhaps even comforting.

Either way, the goodbye is surprisingly short. The two seem to embrace for some time, Nat kneeling on the ground, his arms thrown around [game.creature_name] while its front limbs wrap around him.

And then he's up, explaining with his hands: shooing motions towards the forest, palms held up between [game.creature_name] and Lotosk.

[game.creature_name] takes a few steps towards the forest, then turns back in a quick rush towards the town, but it doesn't make it more than a few steps before it plants its limbs firmly into the ground, creating a remarkably good illusion of what it would look like if it had just run face first into a barrier. Then she looks at Nat, who nods.

There is a pause, the only movement the flow of tears down Nat's face.

And then [game.creature_name] takes two steps forward and, delicately, uses her tongue-hand to grasp Nat around the wrist. He instinctively reaches down to stroke her glossy fur, but she pulls away, gently, suggestively, tugging him towards the forest.

Nat wails. He falls back to his knees, his arms flailing as he battles with the instinct to hold [game.creature_name] close while also reminding her that she has to go away.
"""

crier """

No! No no no [game.creature_name], I love you I love you I really do, but I can't, I just can't!

If I were anything else than what I am, I would, but I can't! We just can't live in each other's places. I thought maybe we could, but I've been shown that we can't. So you have to go.
"""

"""

Nat pushes himself to his feet and thrusts his hands out, his shaking fingers pointing towards the darkness of the forest.

[game.creature_name] stands still for a long time. Then one of her front limbs snakes up and gently wipes the tears from Nat's face.

He grabs the tentacle and kisses it.

Her tongue comes out and, the fingers slightly bent, she waves farewell.

And then she disappears into the forest, the night swallowing up her shadow black form.

Nat stands for a long time, staring at his feet. His hand idly cups the air, as if he can still feel her soft arm in his hand.

He only looks up when he has spent all his tears. He nods once to you and waits for you to approach.
