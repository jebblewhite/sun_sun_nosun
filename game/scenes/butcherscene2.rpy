    You do realise that one of the best ways to convince someone of your way of thinking in a debate is to start by acknowledging common ground. Not only does it soften them up, always useful, but it also gives you both a common baseline.

    So let me try. You care about yourself, right? Don't worry, that's not the attack that it so obviously sounds like it is, we all do it.

    So we both care about ourselves. We don't want to die. So take it from a fellow self-interested human: the revolution is the answer.

    But for you ... well ... as long as there are inequalities of power, there will be people wanting to dethrone the powerful.

    Political revolutions happen all the time. Every day the Senate, at some level, sees coups and skirmishes. 'The state' doesn't care about you, it will continue to wallow no matter which individuals it is made up of. So nothing will protect you when someone comes along wanting your place.

    Either that, or a revolution, political or otherwise, with a little more teeth comes along and you're the first to be strung up, ruining the natural beauty of the village's biggest tree.

    Because the revolution I call for is social, not political. As I said, we aim to abolish private property and the state, not just instances of each, but the very concept of them as social institutions.

    And while I believe that both are chains holding the working people of this world back, I'm not blind to the fact that breaking chains is an act of destruction. However evil the state and the concept of bourgeois capital are, they are still 'things', things that have defenders and, at times, their own volition.

    When it comes to certain ideas, the difference between 'removal' and 'destruction' is simply semantic. Given the choice, I'll take the hard honest truth of 'destroy' over the deceptive 'remove'.

    So the revolution must be destructive because I refuse to talk about changing the state. I will speak only of destroying it. This is where I differ from most other revolutionaries, even most other socialists.

    The communists could achieve their goals through purely political means. It's why there is a communist party, and communist senators. They dream of an all-powerful proletariat state, and they could, theoretically, and I really do mean theoretically, achieve that dream by bending and twisting our republic until it is more or less the shape they want.

    They want a 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. But how can one dictate unless there is someone taking down your dictation?

    Sorry that sounded better in my head.

    For all the reasons that I explained last time we talked, the state must be destroyed. Not subverted, not 'changed from the inside'. Brought down, probably with violence, from the outside. Because trying to destroy politics with politics will never work. States are fundamentally self-preserving, they will never be persuaded to destroy themselves.

    Besides, fighting politics with politics? It even sounds like a fallacy.

    As for the bourgeoisie, it is already too late, in our Republic at least, to settle #{i}that#{/i} peacefully. They're too tied up with the state, its property and tax laws protect them and their money feeds it.

    You go after the state and the bourgeoisie might just let you pass, but attack the bourgeoisie and the state will crack down. Like an obedient dog, it knows where its food is coming from.

    People are killed for their beliefs all the time in the name of justice. Or if not killed, then as good as.

    By total, I suppose I should say global, although total has some nice implications. The revolution will only be complete when no square mile, no tiny island, no backwater peninsula suffers under the boot of statism, or the bourgeoisie.

    Ambitious? Really?

    Of course it's ambitious, but it is necessary, and necessary for a number of reasons, most of them disappointingly practical. I will #{i}try#{/i} to be quick.

    The first is the interconnectedness of the modern bourgeois world. I believe they refer to it as globalism, and it was a genius move on their part.

    We may still be licking our wounds after our war with the Kingdom, yet do you have any idea how many factories in Alexisgrad are owned by bourgeois from the Kingdom? And how many businesses in the Kingdom are owned by our Republican bourgeois?

    And it goes further, to Il Fersaai, our 'economic allies', and the Empire of Raplee, who supposedly prop up the Kingdom and yet have both political and unofficial-economic embassies in Alexisgrad (names in bold are very much subject to change).

    So you see, the Republic bourgeoisie have outsourced their oppression, while selling their own services to foreign markets in return, meaning that you cannot bring one system down without brining them all down.

    Secondly, and purely strategically, the post-revolutionary world will be one of peace and fraternities of small communities, communities will have no space for militarism and therefore communities which are highly susceptible to foreign invasion.

    And invaded we would be: no government in the world could look at a plot of mostly undefended land and not salivate over the thought of taking it. Add to that the example that it sets, that life liberated from the shackles of the state is better in every way, and every country in the world will be racing to subjugate us.

    Just by existing, we would be too dangerous to the statists to be allowed to live.

    And lastly, and this is where 'total' is more pertinent than 'global', I knew I'd used it for a reason, is that nationalism must be completely extinguished in the hearts and minds of every human on this planet.

    Partly this one is because nationalism is just purely bad. I would give you an analogy, but the only thing I can think of is faeces, and I've spent enough time around animal digestive systems to understand that even that has a purpose.

    Partly it is because nationalism is the fertiliser of statism.

    But mostly because, by design, nationalism acts as blinkers, or if I were to be more direct and say what I actually think, nationalism is a knife the state uses to gouge its own people's eyes out.

    Keeping the people worshipping at the altar of something which either doesn't exist, in this case national glory or 'national spirit', or is actively oppressing them is a brilliant way to make sure they don't notice their own chains.

    Or, more insidiously, the state knows that the people realise that they have an enemy, so they invented nationalism as a way to con them into thinking it is foreigners, rather than their own government.

    Either way, it's a cataract. Yes, I'll take that analogy out of the three that I've given you so far. It blinds people to their own actual desires and will. It distorts people's ideals.

    Okay, for the sake of the argument, I will say, although not really believe, that there are some positive aspects of nationalism.

    It's nice that we can all come together and celebrate the warm, cosy, good things that we do as a community. It would be nice if we did that because we're good people with common sense, but let's pretend for a moment that nationalism is how we get there.

    What happens to these positive traits, the brotherhood that nationalism supposedly creates, when there are no nations? When all humans are equal and are acknowledged by all to be so?

    We will all be bound together in one global fraternity, for want of a suitable non-gendered word, and any celebration of that union will not be nationalism, for nationalism implies the existence of some excluded, 'other' group.

    So a nationalist in a post-revolution world would have naught to celebrate but exclusionary statist slavery.

    I by no means want to reduce the amount of contact that people from across the world have with each other. The society the revolution will create will be far more free to move and explore than the one that currently exists.

    Just because the standard social model will be small communities of individuals, brought together by their own voluntary desire to form a fellowship, does not mean that those communities shouldn't, or wouldn't, be diverse.

    If the advantages you have so eloquently pointed out are anything to go by, I would say that it is safe to assume that the communities would be diverse: there are so many advantages to it.

    Why will the revolution be final? For the opposite reason to why no state will ever reign eternally: equality.

    You see, states are, by their very nature, rule of the few over the many. Well, to crawl even further up my arse, even #{i}that#{/i} is semantically redundant, since the position of the few over the many, or at least the position of some over another, is already implied by the word 'rule'.

    It is #{i}that#{/i} inequality that makes states conservative. The world must stay the same so that the ruling class can continue to have more than the ruled class.

    But if you take that inequality away, then the world, and the people in it, are free to change as much as they want.

    But I'm approaching the question arse first. The main reason the revolution will be final is because after the ideal of the people is realized, no one will have any reason to attempt another revolution.

    Likewise, no-one will ever desire any political movement, as to do so would risk the equality and liberty that they have learnt are the cornerstones of their emancipation.

    Lastly, and very much least...ly, because what I have already said makes it irrelevant, but I think it's worth mentioning that after the revolution, and the abolition of state institutions, there will be no standing armies, or military organisations. For purely practical reasons, no one would be #{i}able#{/i} to carry out another revolution even if they wanted to, which they won't.

    Some of that may sound slightly â€¦ airy, but that is because I am yet to explain the 'ideal of the people'.

    I've explained why the revolution will be total, final and destructive. That's all theory. It's true, but it's all been discussed ad nauseam in smoky underground bars in Alexisgrad. It's both dry and, sadly, not original. Very little of it is mine.

    But I'm not incapable of reaching conclusions on my own. And not just theoretical conclusions. Practical ones. Which you may think isn't as good, but please, really? Which ideas get food on the table, the actionable ones or the theoretical ones?

    No, I've come to my own, admittedly basic and obvious, conclusion. When do you strike against an enemy? When they're weakest. When is the state weakest? When things are in flux. What is the biggest change that has occurred, not just to our society but our entire world, in the last, well I don't even know, thousand years?

    It's a rhetorical question, we both know it's the sun disappearing. [textinsert]If our own dear Alderman is anything to go by, every government in the world is soiling itself right now.

    And what's more, the people might finally be waking up to the reality of their lives. Their state, their bourgeoisie, neither of them saved them from the night. Neither of them is #{i}going#{/i} to save them from the night. So why do they need them?

    The people will be scared, as they should be. Thoughtful, compassionate decision making has never been so important to their lives, but small, self-interested, conservative groups are the only ones who currently have the power to do it.

    You can taste the revolution in the air. Anyone who tells you that our republic is still alive is either an idiot or a desperate, lying statist. The same goes for the Kingdom, Il Fersaai, Raplee, every state on the planet.

    And anyone who thinks that the institution of private property will survive is equally evil or stupid. The settlements which, and the individuals who, don't collectivise will die.

    Just a few minutes ago I said that the idea of a total, global revolution was far-fetched. But look around you. Look at the world. It's not really far-fetched at all.

    It's inevitable.

    The only risk, the only obstacle standing between us and true social revolution, is political revolution. Because trust me, the communists, the fascists, possibly even the radical liberals, they're all having this exact same conversation right now. Any one of them could turn the inevitable revolution into their own political coup.

    And I really fear that they will. The power of 'state' is simply too strong. We are living through the best opportunity humanity has ever been given to organise itself in a just, equal and free way, and we're going to lose it because we couldn't get our message out fast enough.

    What I truly dream of doing â€¦ no. No, no we're getting off topic. This was supposed to be a lesson on oppression for our new member of the ruling elite. Not the birth of the anarchist revolution.

    Besides, I've taken up more than enough of your time. So I'll say that you're ready. Congratulations, you've graduated with honours, go and take your meaningless qualification and use it to be an oppressive bastard.

    Tell the Alderman you fully understand all the problems with the system you exist to uphold and are ready to ignore every single one of them.

    Now I've got to get back to my pigs. I'm slightly afraid that they may have gone rotten in the time that I've been out here talking to you.

    [textinsert2]I'm impressed you stayed to listen to the whole thing.

    Although you probably didn't feel like you had the choice â€¦

    Anyway, cheery-bye!
