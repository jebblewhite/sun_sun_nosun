"""

It is not a surprise that you have never noticed the hut before.  True, it is small and the thick snow that surrounds it makes it hard to spot, but the real reason that you have not seen it before is simply that you rarely journey this far down the river.

No, there is nothing mysterious or unsettling about your discovery of the little hut.  You only start to feel uneasy as you push open the door, the metallic snapping sound informing you too late that in doing so you broke some long ago rusted lock.

The hut, as you had guessed it would be, judging by its size, is a single room.  A single bed, neatly made, stretches along the back wall, while a simple wooden chair sits in what you judge to be the dead centre of the room, facing towards the door.  The rest of the small space is taken up by containers of every kind: cupboards, barrels, chests, baskets, etc.

All of this, however, you only notice the second time you look into the room.  The first time you had recoiled almost instantly as the long enclosed space disgorged its contents of foul air, the competition between the stenches of rot and waste passed as both escaped into the freezing night air.

And, of course, it was not the furniture you really noticed first when you looked in that second time.  Really it was the corpse, desiccated and skeletal but still very much in the process of rotting, propped up stiffly on the chair, its frozen eyes still watching the door.

You take a step inside, maybe holding something over your nose, maybe simply breathing the thick air in through your mouth.  As you cross the threshold your lantern picks out what you first take to be a semi-circle of frost around the door, but quickly deduce, from the way that this hut was more or less securely isolated from the outside world, that it must instead be salt.

There is more salt on the window sills, and the glints of white indicate that there is salt in the corpse's hair, and a small pile pooled in his lap.  Probably none inside him though, judging from the smell.

And then you notice the tattoos.  Dark, muddy ink scrawls, each one about an inch tall, cover the right side of the man's torso, from the palm of his hand up to his shoulder and down across the front of his ribs to his pelvis, stopping just short of the man's belt.  

They look like letters, but if they are they are not letters of any language you have ever seen.  Of that you are sure, despite the fact that an entire row of the letters on his arm is bisected by a long, deep scar.

The knife lying in a pool of long dried blood beneath his hanging left hand leaves little question as to where the cut came from.  Or, indeed, how the man had died.  Although his body is so thin you imagine that it would not have been long before starvation would have done the job the knife did.

You take a step away from the body, listening to the silence of the night. [textinsert2]

        Many of the containers are empty.  Many others, well sealed barrels, contain the substances usually produced when an individual doesn't leave an enclosed space for a significant amount of time.

        Only one container, a small chest pushed under the bed, contains anything of note.  A small notebook about half filled with small, neat writing.

                The notes are mostly more or less incomprehensible.  You make out dates and times, what might be locations around the hut and what appears to be a regularly updated inventory of the hut's supplies, but everything is written in a kind of short hand you don't understand.

                That is, until you read the last page.  Everything else up till that point had been bureaucratic, almost scientific.  There were as many numbers as letters.  But the last page reads like a diary:

                'No records for yesterday.  No records for today either.  Probably no more going forward.  No more food anyway.

                I fear I was mad.  I fear that all these weeks, I was wrong.  I fear that there really was nothing out there.  I fear that I wasted all that time hiding from something that really did not exist.

                I fear that, because I now know I did not know there was something there.

                And I know that because I now know that I do know that there is something out there now.

                I thought I could feel it before but I couldn't, but now I can.

                It's out there, waiting for me.  I can hear it, I can feel it, I can sense it.  Now all those other 'clues' I saw before mean nothing.  I have evidence now.

                Now, for the first time, I really can't leave.

                P.S. Yes, I have wondered if maybe only now I am mad and before I was sane.  After all, it feels as if this night has been going on for days.  But to that, I have no answer.  I must simply trust what I see now.

                This night has been far too long.  I can hear bells.  They sound like they are coming from town, but perhaps they are in my head.  Calling me.  I can't leave, not now.  Perhaps it is time to end?'
